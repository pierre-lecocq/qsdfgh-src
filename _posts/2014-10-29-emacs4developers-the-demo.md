The emacs4developers tutorial now has videos to illustrate the emacs basics.
<!--excerpt-->

# The context

Some times ago I wrote a [tutorial for developers](https://github.com/pierre-lecocq/emacs4developers) who want to improve their [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) skills and adapt the editor to their needs.

Therefore, I also created a full session in video that covers some important points:

- Setup: launch Emacs with a special config file, execute a command and open a file
- Basic editing: edit text, select regions, copy&paste, comment&uncomment regions and save a file
- Searching: search text in a buffer or in a project
- Windows and buffers: open windows and navigate through buffers
- Dired mode: Emacs as a file manager
- Shell mode: Emacs as your shell with extended features (execute commands on region ...)

# The video

I uploaded this video on two different platforms (they are small sites and can be down sometimes ...):

- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPZ8yliLYMM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DoPZ8yliLYMM)
- [https://vimeo.com/110356656](https://vimeo.com/110356656)

Thanks for watching!
